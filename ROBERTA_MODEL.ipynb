        "\n",
        "The \"uncased\" in the model name refers to the fact that the model was trained on lowercased text, meaning that the tokenizer will convert all text to lowercase before encoding it. The \"base\" refers to the size of the model, which has approximately 66 million parameters.\n",
        "\n",
        "The main difference between distilbert-base-uncased and the original BERT model is that distilbert-base-uncased has been \"distilled\" or compressed to be smaller and faster, while maintaining a similar level of performance to the original BERT model. This was achieved by removing some of the model's layers and reducing the hidden size of the model.\n",

        "distilbert-base-uncased was trained on a large corpus of English text using a masked language modeling (MLM) objective. In MLM, some of the input tokens are masked, and the model is trained to predict the masked tokens based on the surrounding context. This helps the model learn contextual representations of words, which are useful for many NLP tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "The distilbert-base-uncased model can be fine-tuned on a variety of NLP tasks by adding a task-specific output layer on top of the pre-trained model and fine-tuning the entire network on task-specific data. This fine-tuning process allows the model to adapt to a particular task and achieve state-of-the-art performance on many benchmarks."
